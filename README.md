# Qiskit

Qiskit is an open-source framework for working with quantum computers at the level of circuits, pulses, and algorithms.

A central goal of Qiskit is to build a software stack that makes it easy for anyone to use quantum computers. However, Qiskit also aims to facilitate research on the most important open issues facing quantum computation today.

You can use Qiskit to easily design experiments and run them on simulators and real quantum computers.

Qiskit consists of four foundational elements:

1.Qiskit Terra: Composing quantum programs at the level of circuits and pulses with the code foundation.

2.Qiskit Aer: Accelerating development via simulators and noise models

3.Qiskit Ignis: Addressing noise and errors

4.Qiskit Aqua: Building algorithms and applications
